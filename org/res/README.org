* Introduction
In the lectures we have seen a brief overview of the $q_T$ resummation formalism for the Drell-Yan process.
We will have a closer look at the main results here and highlight some features.

* $q_T$ resummation
In the leading double-logarithmic approximation, we have found the result
#+name: eq:b-space
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\sigma_0}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma}{\mathrm{d}q_T^2}
  &=
  \int_0^\infty\mathrm{d}b \, \frac{b}{2} \, J_0(q_T b) \,
  \exp\Big[
    -\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi}\, C_F \, \ln^2(Q^2 b^2)
  \Big]
  \,,
\end{align}
where we have completely ignored effects from subleading logarithms, the running of the strong coupling, and parton distributions functions.
Nontheless, this simple formula already allows us to inspect some important features of $q_T$ resummation.


* Implementation

** Python
The integral is a bit nasty because of the oscillating behaviour of the Bessel funtion $J_0$ so we need to adapt the =scipy.integrate= settings a little bit.
Despite that, the implementation is straighforward:
#+INCLUDE: "main.py" src python

And we can generate some data files for Drell-Yan and Higgs production
#+begin_src shell :results silent
python main.py  91 q > data_dy.dat
python main.py 125 g > data_h.dat
#+end_src

** Mathematica
To cross-check the numerics, we can use a simple Mathematica implementation
#+begin_src wolfram :results silent
dSigQT2[qt_] := Module[{cf = 4/3, as = 0.118, q = 91},
  NIntegrate[b/2 BesselJ[0, b*qt] Exp[-(as/(2 Pi)) cf Log[q^2 b^2]^2], {b, 0, Infinity}]
]
datQT2 = Table[{qt, dSigQT2[qt]}, {qt, 10^Range[-4, 2, 0.1]}]
Export["mma_dy.dat", datQT2, "Table", "FieldSeparators" -> " "]
#+end_src

** Low-$q_T^2$ behaviour
Let us have a look at the analytic expression for $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}q_T^2$ in the leading double-logarithmic approximation in momentum space.
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\sigma_0}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma}{\mathrm{d}q_T^2}
  &=
  \frac{\alpha_s}{\pi}\, C_F \, \frac{\ln(Q^2 q_T^2)}{q_T^2}
  \exp\Big[
    -\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi}\, C_F \, \ln^2(Q^2 q_T^2)
  \Big]
  \,.
\end{align}
This expression can be obtained from Eq. eqref:eq:b-space by systematically expanding the Fourier transform or alternatively by naively resumming the emissions /without/ the transverse momentum conservation constraint.

We can compare this expression with the numerically evaluated b-space formula from above:

What is important to notice here is that the leading expression shows a strikingly different behaviour in the small $q_T^2$ limit compared to the b-space formula.
The physical interpretation is quite clear: the leading term corresponds to restricting /all/ gluon emissions to have $k_T$ below the gauge-boson transverse momentum $q_T$.
This gives a suppression at low $q_T$ that is stronger than any power and as a consequence, the sub-leading effect suddenly becomes the leading one.
In this situation, the small-$q_T$ region is not restricted to only soft gluon emissions but instead by multiple gluon emissions that can individually have $k_T > q_T$ but they /balance out/ in the azimuthal plane.
By formulating the resummation in impact parameter space, this feature is automatically incorporated in the prediction.

This non-vanishing intercept in $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}q_T^2$ for $q_T\to0$ is a very important feature of trensverse momentum resummation.
In fact, we can compute what this intercept is
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\sigma_0}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma}{\mathrm{d}q_T^2} \biggr\rvert_{q_T=0}
  &=
  \frac{\pi}{2 Q^2}\;\frac{\mathrm{e}^{\frac{\pi}{2\alpha_s C_F}}}{\sqrt{2\alpha_s C_F}}
  \,.
\end{align}

We have also superimposed a dotted line obtained from the Mathematica implementation, which is in good agreement so numerics appear to be under good control.
Note that in my experimentations, Vegas appeared to struggle quite a bit with the oscillating behaviour of the integrand.

** Transverse Momentum Distributioins
We now look at the transverse momentum distrubution, given by
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}q_T
  &=
  2 q_T \; \mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}q_T^2
  \,,
\end{align}
and which does vanish in the $q_T\to0$ limit like a power.
